    "Sports betting is predicted become a multi-billion dollar industry in the United States. Countries around the world have already legalized sports betting and it have set standards and practices. Similar laws are now being passed in Congress that will allow for sports betting around the country. Multiple companies already exist in the two states where sports betting is legal, Nevada and New Jersey, and they are waiting to become a national presence. \n",

    "The data sets contains match data for the past years of Premier League Soccer that is played in the United Kingdom. It is one of the largest and most respected soccer leagues in the world. The games are closely watched by fans around the world and there are hundreds of different types of bets to be placed on large matches like all of the Premier League matches are. \n",

    "I downloaded the data sets from https://www.footystats.org which provides csv files for years of Premier League data. They only provide a few features of pre-match data, which is something that can be improved in the future. Lastly, soccer teams sometimes go on losing stretches and winning stretches which is not a feature that is part of the data set (how many wins in a row, how many losses in a row, avg goals/match in past 5 matches, etc.). These are all features that can be added that can help make the models more accurate. \n",

    "So we see that home wins games around 45.7% of the time considering no other parameters with an average odds of 2.86! Wow! So statistically, if we bet home 100% of the time at the 2.86 odds, we would have a profit of 27%! But lets look a little deeper into this. Note that for soccer, for an perfect equal chance of a Win, Draw, or Loss, the odds for each is 3.0. This situation is where there is no \"house edge\" as shown before. Since it is under 3.0, we see that home always has higher odds to win on average (the lower the decimal, the higher the chance of occuring). \n"

More features are needed that are related to last few games. Lastly I did not have home field advantage feature that I showed had a large effect. A full database of data would be needed and really benefical. This is something I'd like to continue working on as it is good experience with all things software development. I would have to web-scrape odds, set up a database pipeline to store it, and then keep updating data values. I would have to retrain models for each week probably as well.
